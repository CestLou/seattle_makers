Seattle Trading Post connects the community of makers to allow people in the DIY community to learn from each other, and contribute their own skills. Developed for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive. The developers collaborated over a week's time before pushing their child to the depths of the internet.</div>

          Claire recently moved to Seattle to join General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course. As a California transplant she sought to grow her community both within the tech industry, as well as gain new hobbies in the Pacific Northwest. Since most apps glue users to their desktop or mobile device, Claire and her team created the Seattle Trading Post as a way for Seattleites to get out of their comfort zone (in front of their computer) and out making stuff with their community.
